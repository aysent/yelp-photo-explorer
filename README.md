## Getting data

Announcement of the Yelp Dataset Challenge Round 7:

Yelp Dataset Challenge:

Get data:

[https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset)

Download the following two files:

```
yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset.tar
2016_yelp_dataset_challenge_photos.tar
```

Extract files from these archives to 'data' and 'photos' directories:

```
mkdir data
tar xvf yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset.tar -C data
mkdir photos
tar xvf 2016_yelp_dataset_challenge_photos.tar -C photos
```

## Preprocessing data

For each photo extract its name, label, and corresponding business id from json file and save these data in csv format:

```
python json2csv_photos.py > photos.csv
```

For each business extract its id and location (city, latitude, longitude) from json file and save these data in csv format:

```
python json2csv_business.py > business.csv
```

Merge data about photos and corresponding businesses so that we know location of each photo:

```
python merge_photos_business.py
```

For this project we select photos of food and drinks taken in Las Vegas businesses, copy them to a separate directory:

```
python copy_selected_photos.py > copy_selected_photos.sh
source copy_selected_photos.sh
```

In one of the following steps we will extract deep features of selected photos using AlexNet neural network [1] pre-trained and provided by Dato [2]. But before that we resize all photos to 256x256:

```
cd photos_las_vegas_food_drinks
mogrify -resize 256x256\! ./*jpg
cd ..
```

Load and save selected photos and AlexNet model in a format suitable for Dato GraphLab Create [3]:

```
python photos2gl.py
```
