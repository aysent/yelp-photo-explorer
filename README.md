# yelp-photo-explorer

The project allows to explore new Yelp businesses on Google Maps using similarity between photos of food and drinks. The features used for calculation of the similatiry are extracted from photos with pre-trained AlexNet convolutional network. The information about similar photos is stored in a local SQL database. The web app uses Flask python framework, Google Maps JS API, Twitter Bootstrap, SQLite. The ptotoptype of the app is deployed on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk:

## Getting data

Announcement of the Yelp Dataset Challenge Round 7:

[http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/02/yelp-dataset-challenge-round7-announcement.html](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/02/yelp-dataset-challenge-round7-announcement.html)

Yelp Dataset Challenge:

[https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge)

Get data:

[https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset)

Download the following two files:

```
yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset.tar
2016_yelp_dataset_challenge_photos.tar
```

Extract files from these archives to 'data' and 'photos' directories:

```
mkdir data
tar xvf yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset.tar -C data
mkdir photos
tar xvf 2016_yelp_dataset_challenge_photos.tar -C photos
```

## Preprocessing data

For each photo extract its name, label, and corresponding business id from json file and save these data in csv format:

```
python json2csv_photos.py > photos.csv
```

For each business extract its id and location (city, latitude, longitude) from json file and save these data in csv format:

```
python json2csv_business.py > business.csv
```

Merge data about photos and corresponding businesses so that we know location of each photo:

```
python merge_photos_business.py
```

For this project we select photos of food and drinks taken in Las Vegas businesses, copy them to a separate directory:

```
python copy_selected_photos.py > copy_selected_photos.sh
source copy_selected_photos.sh
```

In one of the following steps we will extract deep features of selected photos using AlexNet neural network [1] pre-trained and provided by Dato [2]. But before that we resize all photos to 256x256:

```
cd photos_las_vegas_food_drinks
mogrify -resize 256x256\! ./*jpg
cd ..
```

Load and save selected photos and AlexNet model in a format suitable for Dato GraphLab Create [3]:

```
python photos2gl.py
```

## Extracting deep features

Extract deep features of selected photos using AlexNet neural network:

```
python extract_deep_features.py
```

The output dataset is available on Amazon S3 and can be loaded in python script as:

```python
import graphlab

data = graphlab.SFrame('http://yelp-photo-explorer.s3.amazonaws.com/photos_deep_features.gl')
```

## Example of finding similar photos

This repository provides an example ipython notebook that shows how deep features of photos can be used to train a nearest neighbors and query it to find photos similar to any given photo (PDF version of the notebook correctly shows similar photos).
